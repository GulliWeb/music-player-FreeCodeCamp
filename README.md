# 🎵 FreeCodeCamp Music Player

Welcome to the **FreeCodeCamp Music Player** project! This is a simple yet functional music player built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to play, pause, shuffle, and navigate through a playlist of songs. The project is great for learning how to manipulate the DOM, manage state in JavaScript, and handle media events.

## 🌟 Features

- **Play/Pause**: Play or pause the current song.
- **Next/Previous**: Skip to the next or previous track in the playlist.
- **Shuffle**: Randomly shuffle the playlist.
- **Dynamic Playlist**: Add or remove songs dynamically.
- **Accessible Controls**: Aria labels and keyboard navigation support.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the music player UI.
- `style.css`: Styles for the player and playlist.
- `script.js`: Main logic for song controls, playlist management, and event handling.
